# llama.cpp for legacy devices
Set of patches and workflows to build llama.cpp for uncommon devices, check [releases](https://github.com/PANCHO7532/unsupportedllama/releases) for updated builds

## When is a new build released?
Unfortunately GitHub actions isn't entirely free so i'll be running the workflow whenever I remember this repository exists, or at least one time per week, if you're really desperate for a more up-to-date build, open an issue and ask me to run the workflow

#### More info to be added soon :tm:
